for the working bird"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/bikes-and-birds/":{"body":"In this post, I examine the LeetCode problem, 1057. Campus Bikes.\n\nOn a campus represented on the X-Y plane, there are n workers and m bikes, with n &lt;= m.\nYou are given an array workers of length n where workers[i] = [xi, yi] is the position of the ith worker. You are also given an array bikes of length m where bikes[j] = [xj, yj] is the position of the jth bike. All the given positions are unique.\nAssign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the (workeri, bikej) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other and assign the bike to that worker.\nIf there are multiple (workeri, bikej) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest worker index. If there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with the smallest bike index. Repeat this process until there are no available workers.\nReturn an array answer of length n, where answer[i] is the index (0-indexed) of the bike that the ith worker is assigned to.\nThe Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|.\n\nLeetCode present a couple of solutions, namely (with N as the number of\nworkers, M as the number of bikes, and K as the maximum possible\ndist(worker,bike) where dist is Manhattan distance as defined above): \n\nGenerate all possible (worker, bike) pairs and sort them in order. Then\niterate over the sorted pairs and assign a worker to each pair. Time\nComplexity: O(NM log(NM))\nBucket Sort: O(NM + K)\nPriority Queue: O(NM log(M))\n\nA different approach\nWe're going to explore a modified BFS algorithm to solve this problem. We look\nat the following pseudo-code:\n\ndefine grid: Vec&lt;Vec&lt;Option&lt;i32&gt;&gt; s.t. grid[i][j] = Some(idx) i.f.f. there exists a bike at i,j\nuse a seen array for each worker (we can use seen[i][j][k] to denote\nwhen worker ,i, has seen grid[i][j])\nInitialize state variables to track which bicycle is assigned to which\nworker. i.e. (let mut ans = vec![i32:N], s.t. ans[i] = j implies\nworker i will receive bike j)\nInstantiate a queue of 4-pairs, (worker, i, j, dist), to perform bfs. We maintain two invariants.\n\nfor each pair (w_a, i,j, d_a), there exist no pairs (w_b, k,l, d_b)\ns.t. w_b &gt; w_a and d_b &lt; d_a. That is, because of breadth-first\ntraversal every item after the current item in the queue is either from\na later worker and dist of that item is &gt;= the current item or it is\nfrom an earlier worker and dist &gt; the current item.\n\n\nfor each worker:\n\nWe insert (i, y_i, x_i, 0) into the queue where y_i, x_i are the row\nand column of the ith worker's position.\nWe assign seen[i][y_i][x_i] = true\n\n\nWe now perform bfs, \n\npop an item: (worker, y,x, dist) from the queue,\nif worker has found a bike and grid[found[worker]] is empty, \ncontinue\nif the item is from a worker which hasn't found a bike,\n\nif y,x is a bike, optimistically update the worker's found bike to \nthis bike\no/w - put the neighbors on the queue\n\n\no/w,\n\nif y,x corresponds to a bike:\n\nif that bike's distance is == the found bike,\nupdate the worker's found bike to be the bike with the lower idx\n\n\n\n\nif dist != last_dist or worker != last_worker\n\nif worker has found a bike and that bike is still on the grid,\nremove it from the grid\n\n\n\n\n\nWat\nWhy have I done this? For every ordering of items, there exists a traversal\nthrough a graph that represents them. We let each edge u -&gt; v represent that\nu &lt; v. In O(NM) time, we should be able to construct a graph G s.t.\ndist(u,v) = x i.f.f. w(e -&gt; v) = x. We then add a source node which points\nto w_0 and a dest which is arrived at from w_n. So long as we maintain\nsub-ordering within the edge sets (which may require and additional log M), the shortest path from  source -&gt; destination \nis the ordering we are searching for. BFS will get us a shortest path in \nO(N + M) which yields a total running time of O(NM log(M) + N + M). \nThe question is whether that can be improved by avoiding the ordering of the\nedge sets. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/bikes-and-birds/","title":"it's like riding a bike doesn't mean the same thing for birds"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/in-memory-filesystem/":{"body":"Problem Specification\nAn extremely common interview question is the \"in memory filesystem\",\nHere is an example prompt that I received in the past: \n\nDesign an in-memory file system class, which supports these operations:\nls : takes as a parameter a string. If the string is a file path, return the file name. If the string is a directory path, return a list of file &amp; child directory names in the directory.\nmkdir: takes a path, and creates a directory at it if it does not already exist. Intermediate directories that don’t exist should also be created.\naddContentsToFile: Given a file path &amp; file content (string), if the file exists then append to its content, otherwise create a new file and store the contents there.\ngetContentsFromFile: Given a file path, return file contents in string format.\n\nand here is the relevant LeetCode problem.\nThe first thing we notice is that there a few subtleties which make these\nprompts different. We'll explore these subtleties by exploring a python\nsolution to the leetcode problem and translating it to rust. \nBasic Python Implementation\nGenerally, interviewers expect you to write something like this in python and\nproduce code that looks like the following:\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.child=defaultdict(Node)\n        self.content=\"\"\n        \nclass FileSystem(object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root=Node()\n        \n    def find(self,path):#find and return node at path.\n        curr=self.root\n        if len(path)==1:\n            return self.root\n        for word in path.split(\"/\")[1:]:\n            curr=curr.child[word]\n        return curr\n        \n    def ls(self, path):\n        curr=self.find(path)\n        if curr.content:#file path,return file name\n            return [path.split('/')[-1]]\n        return sorted(curr.child.keys())\n\t\t\n    def mkdir(self, path):\n        self.find(path)\n\n    def addContentToFile(self, filePath, content):\n        curr=self.find(filePath)\n        curr.content+=content\n\n    def readContentFromFile(self, filePath):\n        curr=self.find(filePath)\n        return curr.content\n\nNode\nSo, let's suppose we want to do something similar and translate this code into\nRust.\nWe start with the Node class. A direct translation would look something like\nthe following.\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\nstruct Node {\n    child: HashMap&lt;String,Node&gt;,\n    content: String\n\n}\n\nimpl Node {\n    pub fn new() -&gt; Self {\n        Self {\n            child: HashMap::new(),\n            content: \"\".to_string()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nImmediately, we run into our first problem. Rust doesn't allow recursive data\ntypes like this because there's no way to know the size of Node at compile\ntime. Luckily, that's pretty straightforward. We can just fix that by inserting\na Box.\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\n\nstruct Node {\n    child: HashMap&lt;String,Box&lt;Node&gt;&gt;,\n    content: String\n\n}\n\nimpl Node {\n    pub fn new() -&gt; Self {\n        Self {\n            child: Box::new(HashMap::new()),\n            content: \"\".to_string()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis is only a slight change. Now, child contains a HashMap which contains\na Box. The Nodes while be stored on the heap, and this change will flow\nthrough to create a bit more complexity later.\nFileSystem class\nLet's continue to look at the FileSystem class.\nclass FileSystem(object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root=Node()\n\n    ...\n        \n\nbecomes,\nstruct FileSystem {\n    root: Node\n}\n\nimpl FileSystem {\n    pub fn new() -&gt; Self{\n        Self {\n            root: Node::new()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAnd this is probably the simplest conversion of the whole post.\nFind\n    def find(self,path):#find and return node at path.\n        curr=self.root\n        if len(path)==1:\n            return self.root\n        for word in path.split(\"/\")[1:]:\n            curr=curr.child[word]\n        return curr\n\nThis is where things start to get tricky. We'll come back to this\nimplementation a few times.\nimpl FileSystem {\n       pub fn find(&amp;mut self, path: String) -&gt; &amp;mut Node {\n            let mut curr = &amp;mut self.root; // &amp;mut Node\n            if path.len() == 1 {\n                return &amp;mut self.root // &amp;mut Node\n            }\n            for word in path.split(\"/\") {\n                if let Some(result) = curr.child.get(word) {\n                    curr = result.as_mut(); // &amp;mut Node\n                }\n            }\n            return curr\n       }\n}\n\nMkdir\nNow, let's look at mkdir. The python version relies on the behavior of\ndefaultdict to insert unfound paths.\nimpl FileSystem {\n    pub fn mkdir(&amp;mut self, path: String) {\n        self.find(path);\n    }\n}\n\nLet's go back and update find so that it uses the entry api to get the same\nbehavior.\nimpl FileSystem {\n       pub fn find(&amp;mut self, path: String) -&gt; &amp;mut Node {\n            // we need to move the path check first to avoid a double borrow\n            if path.len() == 1 {\n                return &amp;mut self.root // &amp;mut Node\n            }\n\n            let mut curr = &amp;mut self.root; // &amp;mut Node\n            \n            // advance the iterator once to get past the first null split\n            for word in path.split(\"/\").skip(1) {\n                curr = curr.child.entry(word).or_insert(Box::new(Node::new())); // &amp;mut Node\n            }\n            return curr\n       }\n}\n\nThat makes the rest of the implementation flow fairly straightforwardly, \nThe rest\nimpl FileSystem {\n    pub fn ls(&amp;mut self, path: String) -&gt; Vec&lt;String&gt; {\n        let curr = self.find(path);\n        if curr.content != \"\" {\n            return vec![path.split(\"/\").last().unwrap()]\n        }\n        let mut ans = curr.child.keys().collect();\n        ans.sort();\n        ans\n    }\n    pub fn add_content_to_file(&amp;mut self, path: String, content: String) {\n        let curr = self.find(path);\n        curr.is_file = true;\n        curr.content.push_str(&amp;content);\n    }\n    pub fn read_content_from_file(&amp;mut self, path: String) -&gt; String {\n        let curr = self.find(path);\n        curr.content\n    }\n}\n\nUh-oh\nBut wait, now whenever we call FileSystem::ls(path) we allocate the memory\nfor a directory structure. This makes the following test fail, \n    let mut fs = FileSystem::new();\n    fs.ls(\"/a/b/c\");\n    fs.ls(\"/a\") // =&gt; outputs \"b\"\n\nThe solution also doesn't allow for the existence of files with empty strings,\n    let mut fs = FileSystem::new();\n    fs.add_content_to_file(\"/a/b/c\",\"\");\n    fs.ls(\"/a/b/c\"); // =&gt; outputs \"\" instead of \"c\"\n\nBoth of these can be solved with relative ease by introducing a flag on Node, \nuse std::collections::HashMap;\nstruct Node {\n    child: HashMap&lt;String,Node&gt;,\n    content: String,\n    is_file: false\n}\n\nAnd then handling the flag in add_content_to_file and ls.\nimpl FileSystem {\n    pub fn add_content_to_file(&amp;mut self, path: String, content: String) {\n        let curr = self.find(path);\n        curr.is_file = true;\n        curr.content.push_str(&amp;content);\n    }\n\n    pub fn ls(&amp;mut self, path: String) -&gt; Vec&lt;String&gt; {\n        let curr = self.find(path);\n        if curr.is_file {\n            return vec![path.split(\"/\").last().unwrap()]\n        }\n        let mut ans = curr.child.keys().collect();\n        ans.sort();\n        ans\n    }\n}\n\nNow, let's look at find\nimpl FileSystem {\n    pub fn find(&amp;mut self, path: String) -&gt; &amp;mut Node {\n            // we need to move the path check first to avoid a double borrow\n            if path.len() == 1 {\n                return &amp;mut self.root // &amp;mut Node\n            }\n\n            let mut curr = &amp;mut self.root; // &amp;mut Node\n            \n            // advance the iterator once to get past the first null split\n            for word in path.split(\"/\").skip(1) {\n                curr = curr.child.entry(word).or_insert(Box::new(Node::new())); // &amp;mut Node\n            }\n            return curr\n       }\n}\n\nWhat we actually want to do here is abstract out the curr update.\n    pub fn find(&amp;mut self, path: String, f: ????) -&gt; &amp;mut Node {\n            // we need to move the path check first to avoid a double borrow\n            if path.len() == 1 {\n                return &amp;mut self.root // &amp;mut Node\n            }\n\n            let mut curr = &amp;mut self.root; // &amp;mut Node\n            \n            // advance the iterator once to get past the first null split\n            for word in path.split(\"/\").skip(1) {\n                //curr.child.entry(word).or_insert(Box::new(Node::new()))\n                curr = f(word); // &amp;mut Node\n            }\n            return curr\n       }\n\n\n\nWe want f's type to be |curr: &amp;mut Node, word: String| -&gt; &amp;mut Node, but\nthat really begs the question -- does passing a function as a parameter make\nsense here? We've just defined the function signature of what really just looks\nlike a method to me. So, let's try implementing create and find on the node\nitself.\nimpl Node {\n    pub fn new() -&gt; Self {\n        Self {\n            child: HashMap::new(),\n            content: String::new()\n        }\n    }\n    pub fn create(&amp;mut self, name: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;mut Node {\n        self.child.entry(name.to_string()).or_insert_with(|| Box::new(Node::new())).as_mut()\n    }\n\n    pub fn find(&amp;mut self, name: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;mut Node {\n        self.child.get_mut(name).unwrap()\n    }\n}\n\n}\nimpl FileSystem {\n    pub fn find(&amp;mut self, path: String, create: bool) -&gt; &amp;mut Node {\n            // we need to move the path check first to avoid a double borrow\n            if path.len() == 1 {\n                return &amp;mut self.root // &amp;mut Node\n            }\n\n            let mut curr = &amp;mut self.root; // &amp;mut Node\n            \n            // advance the iterator once to get past the first null split\n            for word in path.split(\"/\").skip(1) {\n                //curr.child.entry(word).or_insert(Box::new(Node::new()))\n                curr = match create {\n                    true =&gt; curr.create(word),\n                    false =&gt; curr.find(word)\n                }; // &amp;mut Node\n            }\n            return curr\n       }\n}\n\nThat works pretty well. But the return type of HashMap::get_mut is Option\nwhich really highlights another shortcoming of the problem. How should we deal\nwith ls /b/cee/d/a when b/cee/ doesn't exist? Neither of the original\nprompts address the case. So, our current implementation will just panic\n(thanks to the unwrap call on Node::find).\nHere's what the final rust implementation looks like: \nuse std::collections::HashMap;\n\nstruct Node {\n    is_file: bool,\n    child: HashMap&lt;String,Box&lt;Node&gt;&gt;,\n    content: String\n}\n\nimpl Node {\n    pub fn new() -&gt; Self {\n        Self {\n            child: HashMap::new(),\n            content: String::new(),\n            is_file: false\n        }\n    }\n    pub fn create(&amp;mut self, name: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;mut Node {\n        self.child.entry(name.to_string()).or_insert_with(|| Box::new(Node::new())).as_mut()\n    }\n\n    pub fn find(&amp;mut self, name: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;mut Node {\n        self.child.get_mut(name).unwrap()\n    }\n}\n\nstruct FileSystem {\n    root: Node\n}\n\nimpl FileSystem {\n    pub fn new() -&gt; Self {\n        Self {\n            root: Node::new()\n        }\n    }\n\n    pub fn find(&amp;mut self, path: String, create: bool) -&gt; &amp;mut Node {\n            if path.len() == 1 {\n                return &amp;mut self.root // &amp;mut Node\n            }\n\n            let mut curr = &amp;mut self.root; // &amp;mut Node\n            // advance the iterator once to get past the first null split\n            for word in path.split(\"/\").skip(1) {\n                curr = match create {\n                    true =&gt; curr.create(word),\n                    false =&gt; curr.find(word)\n                };\n            }\n            return curr\n        }\n\n\n\n    pub fn ls(&amp;mut self, path: String) -&gt; Vec&lt;String&gt; {\n        let curr = self.find(path.clone(),false);\n        if curr.is_file {\n            return vec![path.split(\"/\").last().unwrap().to_owned()]\n        }\n        let mut ans = curr.child.keys().cloned().collect();\n        ans.sort();\n        ans\n    }\n\n    pub fn add_content_to_file(&amp;mut self, path: String, content: String) {\n        let curr = self.find(path,true);\n        curr.is_file = true;\n        curr.content.push_str(&amp;content);\n    }\n\n    pub fn mkdir(&amp;mut self, path: String) {\n        self.find(path,true);\n    }\n\n    pub fn read_content_from_file(&amp;mut self, path: String) -&gt; String {\n        let curr = self.find(path,false);\n        curr.content.to_string()\n    }\n}\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/in-memory-filesystem/","title":"the perils of the in memory filesystem"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/bikes-and-birds/":{"body":417,"title":8},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/in-memory-filesystem/":{"body":1000,"title":3}},"length":4},"lang":"English"};
